# Introduction to jQuery
Microsoft: DEV208x Introduction to jQuery

## About this course
jQuery is an open source JavaScript library. jQuery offers developers additional power and ease of use,
as well as cross browser support, that JavaScript alone does not. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript
library in use.
This course is designed to be a primer on jQuery. During the course, you will learn how to perform
common tasks with jQuery, implement the most frequently used features and components in the
library.

### Module 1: Adding jQuery to web pages
During the first module, we will introduce jQuery and discuss various scenarios in which you’ll use
jQuery. You’ll see how to add jQuery to a page, as well as some common editors for jQuery and
JavaScript. We’ll explore jQuery’s powerful DOM traversal and selection capabilities, both through CSS
selectors as well as through code. We’ll close by highlighting some common changes you can make on a
page through jQuery.

### Module 2: Managing content, events and effects
Module two begins by investigating how to manage events using jQuery. We’ll talk through several
events jQuery allows you to bind to. We’ll see various ways to register event handlers, and ensure your
code is executed at the correct time, and in the correct way. Because jQuery offers great support for 
manipulating and restructuring HTML pages, we’ll walk through some of the various operations that can
be performed to update the DOM. We’ll also see how jQuery allows you to enhance the user’s
experience through various effects.

### Module 3: Asynchronous operations and Ajax calls
Sometimes you will create JavaScript code that takes longer than a reasonable amount of time to
execute. jQuery provides support for managing asynchronous calls through promises, which we’ll
introduce in this module. We’ll also take a look at web workers, which is an HTML5 feature that allows
developers to simulate threading in a browser. We’ll close by taking a look at how to make calls to the
server by using JavaScript and jQuery. We’ll even take a peek at how to create the necessary server-side
code as well.
